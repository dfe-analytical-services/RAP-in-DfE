## The DfE R packages

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="70%"}
The Statistics Development Team are developing packages for use in R to support the analytical community in having common useful functions readily available for their work. 

They're published on the [DfE Analytical Services GitHub page](https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services) and are ready to use.

In this coffee and coding, I'll give a brief introduction to what the scope of these packages is, how to install them, demo some of their functionality and tell you how you can help!

### Succinct functions that saves coding effort and make analysts lives easier!

dfeR should provide simple code to make it easier for analysts to work effectively and consistently.

## Intro to the team

## Explore education statistics (EES)

[Explore education statistics (EES)](https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/) was launched in 2020. This is our own statistics publication platform that requires common open data standards for all published data and statistics. EES concentrates on open data standards, whilst also stripping out a large proportion of the typical statistics production process (i.e. formatted Excel tables). The open data is also easily reusable for other services or dashboards.

## EES data screener

Before being uploaded to EES, data must be run through an internal data screener. The screener runs a multitude of automated tests against the data files, including checking ONS geographies.
