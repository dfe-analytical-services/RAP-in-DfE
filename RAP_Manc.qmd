## Intro to the team

## EES & data screener

## Internal standards (good, great and best)

## Self-assessment tool

::: columns
::: {.column width="100%"}
- [Internally hosted R Shiny app](https://rsconnect/rsc/publication-self-assessment/) for statistics publication teams and team leaders to assess progress towards Good, Great and Best RAP standards.

- Teams are encouraged to update their self assessments regularly 

- Recently added a progress monitoring tab for individual publications and G6s.

- Can also use it to identify teams that might need guidance and targeted support

## Champions network
::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}

- We currently have 20 RAP champions across the department
- Varying professions and based across different groups/areas
- Not all champions work in areas with statistics production teams
- Monthly meetings for discussions about progress, presenting results, knowledge sharing and training so we can work towards a shared goal
- All champions have the opportunity to input into next steps

## Implementation plan

## Hints and tips

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}

- Build an internal champions network!
- Have a clear argument for WHY we're doing this
- Get line managers on board
- Make communications fun and engaging (emojis work well)
- Focus on RAP as proportionate to the project
- If teams are overwhelmed, encourage focus on one element at a time 
- Keep best practice examples to share
- Make what you're doing as visible as possible
